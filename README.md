An Hybrid mobile application using Phonegap - Cordova framework uses an RESTful web api provided by the Indian Railways and displays information.
The application uses javascript to consume web api, and parse the response data and displays information like train list, routes, stops, timings, seat availability, seat price for different class and age groups.
We also managed to integrate paypal with the application which allows user to pay for the ticket during booking.
